# ðŸ“Š Credit Risk Analysis (Excel + SQL + Power BI)  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project is an **end-to-end Credit Risk Analysis** workflow where I worked with a dataset of over **32,000 loan records**. The goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize borrower behavior and loan risk patterns using **Excel, SQL, and Power BI**.  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills Used  
- **Excel** â†’ Cleaned & transformed 32K+ raw records (handled missing values, standardized fields, ensured consistency).  
- **SQL** â†’ Wrote queries on 30K+ rows to extract insights by loan intent, age, grade, employment length, and home ownership.  
- **Power BI** â†’ Built an interactive dashboard with 6+ visuals to present insights clearly.  

## ðŸ”Ž Key Insights  
- **78% of loans** are successfully repaid.  
- Borrowers aged **22â€“25** take the largest share of loans.  
- **Education & Medical loans** dominate the portfolio.  
- **Mortgage holders** request the highest average loan amounts.
